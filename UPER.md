<h1>The Problem Solving Framework : 'UPER'</h1>

* U = "Understand"
* P = "Plan"
* E = "Execute"
* R = "Reflect" / "Refactor"

<h2>1. Understanding the Problem</h2>
*I have to create a store that has the ability to create orders, calculate tax and display
*everything that is done on a receipt.
*
*
*
*
*
*
<h2>
    2. Planning the Solution
</h2>
*I have to first see if I can add items to a list and test it.
*After that I have to get used to the testing to see if all my methods work correctly.
*Then I will find a way to calculate the taxes properly and to differentiate the items
*i.e if its imported it gets the imported tax added and if its exempt it wont get
*the regular tax etc.
*
*
*
<h2>
    3. Executing the Plan
</h2>
*Attempted to do the store first and adding the list, after failing the mob session helped out a lot which
*got me on my feet and allowed me to have a running start.
*There was some places where I got stuck and the rounding was a bit confusing but it worked out well in the end.
*
*
*
*

<h2>
    4. Reflection / Refactor
</h2>
*Testing little by little while creating your project will go a long way, it prevents a lot of bugs and really
*helped a lot overall. This was a fun/ stressful assignment, but great overall.
*I believe it really helped me learn these concepts more even though I'm not the best at them!
